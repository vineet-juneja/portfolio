  <br>   
  Bringing over 23 years of experience in creating value for Clients, building large teams and organizations that are built to last.
  I truly believe that the unique value we provide to our clients, employees and society comes from authenticity and simplicity.
  Spent a lifetime learning how to effectively lead, handle leadership crises, how to inspire confidence, manage and develop talent, turn organizations around, work on organizational culture, handle fearâ€¦ stress, recover from unexpected difficulties, and how to energize and motivate our teams to levels of performance and fulfillment they didn't even realize was possible.
  I have experience in many fields which helps me with a broader perspective and my deep respect for people I am surrounded with, let's me engage with many others for greater possibilities.


  I am also a Data Science entuhisast, tried to learn and work through Python, Big Data, Spark, Machine learning & NLP related problems.
  I will continue to host learning teams for everyone to help their journeys, as there is never enough help ðŸ˜‡
